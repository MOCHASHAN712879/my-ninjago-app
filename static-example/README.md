# Static Ninjago Gallery

This is a **simplified, no-backend version** of the Ninjago character gallery that runs entirely in the browser.

## What's Different:

### No Backend Required ❌
- No Node.js server
- No Express routes
- No API calls
- No database

### Just Static Files ✅
- `index.html` - Page structure
- `styles.css` - All styling
- `data.js` - Character and quest data
- `script.js` - All functionality

## How It Works:

1. **Data Storage**: All character and quest data is stored directly in `data.js` as JavaScript arrays
2. **No API Calls**: Instead of fetching from `/api/characters`, we just use the `characters` array
3. **Pure JavaScript**: DOM manipulation handles all interactivity
4. **Static Hosting**: Can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify, or any static file host

## To Run This:

1. Download all 4 files to a folder
2. Open `index.html` in any web browser
3. That's it! No installation, no server setup

## What You Can Do:

- ✅ View character gallery
- ✅ Click characters to see details  
- ✅ Navigate to quests page
- ✅ View all seasons 1-15
- ✅ Fully responsive design
- ✅ Retro gaming theme

## Technologies Used:

- **HTML** - Structure
- **CSS** - Styling (with CSS Grid, Flexbox, animations)  
- **JavaScript** - Functionality (DOM manipulation, event handling)

## File Sizes:

- `index.html` - ~3KB
- `styles.css` - ~8KB  
- `data.js` - ~3KB
- `script.js` - ~4KB
- **Total: ~18KB** (vs 50MB+ with Node.js + dependencies)

This shows that you can build impressive web projects with just the core web technologies!
